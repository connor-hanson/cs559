p3 submission. Implements gl-matrix. Basically is one big rotating disk with smaller rotating discs on its border. 
Takes in image file data. I tested it on both a localhost and on my cs.pages website. They both work. Hopefully it does 
on the cs grading page too. 

Its pretty freaking cool tho. I'm pretty proud of this project.
